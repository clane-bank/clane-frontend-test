### Notes
- This is a test of your knowlege of frontend javascript, therefore
  - You are not allowed to use any frontend frameworks
  - You are expected to provide your solution in vanilla javascript
  - Do not worry about the security.
  - Handle validation properly for `POST/PUT` requests 
- Source code must be stored in a git repository (you can send us a link to a github or bitbucket repo)
  - For public repos:
	  - Avoid words like `clane` and `challenge`.
	  - This is needed to prevent other candidates from finding your solution.
- Your repo should be easy to setup with clear instruction.
- (Optional) Deploy as a public site to your own host.
- (Optional) PWA
- (Optional) Mobile Responsive

### Expection
- This challange should take around 4 hours to complete.
- You can work on it at your own schedule, but a complete solution is expected within 7 days.
- Your code should be modular, each module should focus on doing one thing and do it well.
- Please over-engineering is allowed.
- Error handling and retry if backend is busy.
- Use of third-party library is prohibited.
- We frown at code repetitions and we expect a more clean code.
- We value code reusability.
- We value offline first where necessary.
- We love well documented codebase with good naming conventions.
- We favour good code structure.
